# CGAN-for-MNIST-handwritten-dataset
a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating handwritten digits! GANs are a type of machine learning model where two neural networks compete with each other. One network, the generator, creates new data (in this case, images of digits), while the other, the discriminator, tries to determine if the data is real or generated. I used the MNIST dataset, which consists of images of handwritten digits, to train my GAN. After training, my GAN was able to generate realistic-looking handwritten digits that are almost indistinguishable from the real ones! I implemented this project using PyTorch, a powerful deep learning framework, and utilized convolutional neural networks for both the generator and discriminator. One of the biggest challenges was stabilizing the training process, as GANs can be tricky to train. I experimented with different hyperparameters and techniques to achieve better results. In the future, I plan to explore more advanced GAN architectures and apply them to other datasets. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this project! Feel free to check out the code on my GitHub or connect with me for more details. #MachineLearning #GAN #PyTorch #MNIST
